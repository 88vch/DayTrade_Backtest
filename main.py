    # 2. load data from $(STOCK) to dict()
    # 3. check if setups are viable on day's chart
    # 4. upload results back to notion

    # Extra. create chart from data
    # - download/save chart locally (e.g., charts/*) as type(img)
    # - if we can do this, we will simply make another notion integration to upload the chart there
